# codeglish
A communication language only for die-hard programmers.

## 0. Basics

- If there is a noun that needs to be highlighted, ending can be `.exe` (or your favorite file extension). Eg: I've pushed the changes to github.exe
- Every chat initiates with `thug` or `mans`.
- Don't use thumbs up emoji/reaction. Instead use üêí (Dancing monkey)
